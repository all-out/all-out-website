# django-app-template
Basic structure of a django app, for reuse when starting new apps.

(Optional): Make a github repository

Make the virtual environment on your machine using the repository name you intend to use for this project: `mkproject repository_name`

Go up one level, out of your project folder that was just created (`cd ..`) and delete it: `rmdir repository_name`

Clone this repository, using the project's name: `git clone git@github.com:mosbasik/django-app-template.git repository_name`

Enter your local repo (`cd repository_name`) and set its origin remotes to the github repo you just created, preferably using the SSH link: `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/OTHERREPOSITORY.git`
